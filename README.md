Interactive Dashboard for a Transportation App

My role. Power BI developer

Project description. I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard for a transportation app, focusing on UI/UX for a seamless experience. The dataset was cleaned using Excel Power Query, and I used DAX to create key metrics and remove blanks. The dashboard, with pages for Overview, Cancellations, Confirmed Trips, and Final Map, addressed client-specific questions. It showcased booking trends, top drivers, payment methods, and cancellations, providing insights to improve customer experience and operational efficiency.

The Dashboard layout: The Overview Page contains key insights. The dashboard has other 4 pages, each answering client-specific questions using their brand colors.
